# Pig Game python project
 
This project was developed for the Methods for sustainable development course at the University of Kristianstad.
The idea for the project is to make a simple game that is CLI based. Some elements were developed rather simple, such as the intelligence part where the "intelligence" just chooses if it should continue or not.
====================================================================
## To run the game
First do the following:
´´´
    make venv

    make install
```
This will ensure you have everything installed.

And to run the code you will have to execute the following line in the command terminal.
```
    python piggame/shell.py
```
Once done you should be able to play the game.
